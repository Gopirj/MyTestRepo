The existing virtual mouse system, employing hand gestures for computer interaction, provides a straightforward 
method for controlling the mouse cursor and executing basic tasks. Utilizing a hand recognition system and image 
processing techniques, users can perform actions such as pointer control, left and right clicks, and dragging 
motions. However, to enhance its capabilities and usability, the proposed work aims to integrate advanced machine 
learning methods to enable the system to recognize a wider range of hand gestures accurately. By leveraging AutoPy, 
mathematical operations, and refined mouse control algorithms, the enhanced system will offer users a more 
intuitive and seamless experience, catering to a broader spectrum of users, including those with physical 
limitations or those seeking a hands-free approach to computer interaction.
